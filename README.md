# CLICalculator
**This is my implementation of RPN calculator in Java.**

**Reverse Polish Notation** (RPN) provides the quickest way to enter data in a calculator because it eliminates the need for parenthesis. It was made mainstream by HP when they implemented it in their famous programmable calculators.

### How to use it
Unlike with a traditional calculator, you enter the parameters first, than the operator. For example, to calculate '20+50' input must be like :
```
> 20
> 50
> -
```
